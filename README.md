This repository contains Apache Airflow DAG examples demonstrating different approaches to building data pipelines, ranging from basic PythonOperator usage to modern TaskFlow API patterns, along with a sample ML pipeline structure.

The goal of this project is to:

Understand Airflow task dependencies

Learn XCom-based communication

Compare classic DAGs vs TaskFlow API

Build readable, maintainable workflows
